                                Breast cancer is a malignant disease that develops in the cells of the breast. It 
                                can take various forms, including ductal and lobular carcinomas. It is one of the 
                                most common diseases in women, although men can also be affected. Early detection 
                                is essential, and can be achieved by methods such as breast self-examination and 
                                regular mammograms. Common symptoms of breast cancer include nodules in the breasts, 
                                changes in breast shape or size, pain and discharge from the nipples. Treatment varies 
                                according to the stage of the cancer, but may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy 
                                and other modalities. Breast cancer prevention involves raising awareness, reducing risk 
                                factors such as excessive alcohol consumption and obesity, and promoting healthy lifestyles. 
                                Ongoing research is essential to improve treatment and quality of life for those affected by this disease.

                                Skin cancer, also known as cutaneous cancer, is a form of cancer that develops in 
                                the cells of the skin. It can take different forms, including basal cell carcinoma, 
                                squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma. Skin cancer is usually caused by excessive 
                                exposure to the sun's ultraviolet (UV) rays or to artificial tanning beds. Early 
                                detection is crucial to effective treatment, and regular monitoring for changes 
                                in moles, spots or skin lesions is essential. Sun protection and safety practices, 
                                such as using sunscreen and avoiding excessive sun exposure, play an essential 
                                role in preventing skin cancer.

                                Myocardial infarction, commonly known as heart attack, is a serious condition that occurs 
                                when blood flow to the heart muscle is blocked or severely reduced, often due to the build-up 
                                of atheromatous plaque in the coronary arteries. This can lead to life-threatening damage to 
                                the heart muscle. The most common symptoms are intense chest pain, shortness of breath, excessive 
                                sweating and pain in the arms, neck or jaw. Immediate medical intervention is crucial to minimize 
                                damage to the heart muscle and improve chances of survival. Preventing myocardial infarction 
                                generally involves managing risk factors such as high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, 
                                obesity and stress, as well as adopting a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet and 
                                regular physical activity.
